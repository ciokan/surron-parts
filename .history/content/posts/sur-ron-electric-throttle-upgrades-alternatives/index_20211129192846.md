When it comes to electric throttles for your sur-ron there aren't many options that you can review and all of them ar worst than the stock one. I know that because I purchased and tested them hoping for a smaller travel since I have a bad right wrist that hurts and prevents me from accelerating without pain.

So far, the only alternatives to the stock electronic throttle, that I know of, are the **Domino** and the **Magura**. 

If you have the Feb 2021+ Sur-ron model, I'm going to cut it short, and let you know that **the stock one is better built** and that the alternatives do not work any more (not without changes to the electronics at least). 

Since my bikes is only 2 months old suffice to say I wasted my money on these controllers but at least I got the chance to see them, hold them and "weigh" them. Trying to read the voltage output I even burnt [the potentiometer](http://d.digikey.com/dc/KnEa49LIxePFwHl32X6QVyUOcnIt-tgKgDpUrans5qJECEKNz1RnIAuvBP1KcmU5uENRvOIBHD05tshjVZ5D7rVGOcCAq8nhs47Sq48x9pekbhT3lEy9WQ-QAdMxXVgaWtN3L00OthToOlpIg_38KkUqoIjIPzImbBYpSMw_lpWDE7yDJ30ebFG3XZuo8Yb1ddIEELofAYyb3BAtj43f4N-L1s3MIeDSa4Lqf6PcFTKSKMpuw8ySXM2VLzpyE7fo/MDI4LVNYSy01MDcAAAGA_NKbfckiXjsZwVSdlGXahZju7nhF36_9AhDNp3Tum6FNdhLlc2qFbwCu3mOX8wuG-nwizT4=) of the Domino which revealed a new set of issues but more on that later because I want to go into detail on all 3 of them.

## Sur-ron stock electronic throttle review

I'm gonna be honest here and say that I tried to change everything that I could on this bike (except for the frame, battery and controller) just because it is made in China, by a Chinese company.

All parts that I saw, with few exceptions, are lacking any sort of identifiable marks, bars or serials. Searching for alternative parts is a PITA and you must rely on reddit and YouTube pioneers for clues.

While doing these replacements and once I assessed I noticed that some parts are really well made. I also found many improvements in comparison to details noticeable on YouTube videos which means this company is responding to feedback in a positive manner.

### Better materials

I derailed a bit but I wanted to land here and say that the stock throttle is better than the Domino or the Magura. It is made out of aluminium where you screw it to the handlebar and out of plastic where it needs to be light. I assembled and disassembled this throttle multiple times trying to see how it operates and I never had an issue.

Even the wire on the stock is multiple times better than what you'll find on the alternatives. It is sturdier (but maleable), difficult to break when pulling it and tight. It features a double coating for protection where the first one seems to be some sort of special paper that is hard to tear as well and the outer shell of course.

### Better components

While the Domino and Magura operate using a 5k resistance potentiometer, the stock one uses a TPS (throttle position sensor) which is much, much better at least on some key points.

Using a TPS they eliminated many moving parts which leads to less resistance or drag when opening or closing the throttle. There is, of course, the spring inside that offers resistance but that is controlled and you're only fighting the spring, nothing else.

### Better performance and future proof
Since there is no friction, parts will last much longer. The TPS sensor is encapsulated/sealed and I have a strong feeling this throttle will work even submerged under water without issues. The actual handle part spins on a bearing inside the throttle which makes it way sturdier, with minimal side-to-side play and...fixable. Since bearings are made to spin I strongly believe this throttle will last you a long time.

Since potentiometers can corrode, get damaged when the humidity is high or respond poorly with dust I'm almost certain the Magura and Domino will degrade faster both in delivery and performance without frequent servicing but...good luck with that, the servicing part.

## Domino throttle review 

Unfortunately, the Domino is built like a cheap Chinese part (oh the irony) when comparing it with the stock throttle.

### Does not work with 2021 Sur-rons

I placed this as the first paragraph in an attemopt to stop you from wasting money. It may have been a plug-and-play for older models but the new controllers will not accept it - it stays dead.

### Smaller twist travel

One of the pro points for the Domino throttle that led me to actually purchase it was the smaller twist travel it takes from 0 to full power. As I mentioned, I have a bad wrist on the right hand which prevents me from twisting as I am with my left hand for example.

You will find [some videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBs3t8bFx64) regarding the Domino where, one of the key points highlighted, is the smaller amount of twist travel it takes from 0 to max. I agree to that, the difference is not that big but just enough.

### Good snap back to initial

At first try, the Domino was snapping back to initial position better than stock but, after lubing the internals of the stock one a bit I found them to be equally snappy.

### Cheap build with weak materials

The Domino is made entirely out of plastic. I only removed the screws once to check it out internally and 3 of them started twisting forever when trying to put everything back. The part that tightens on the handlebar is also made out of plastic and will crack or degrade the performance of the throttle if you try to tighten them strongly (as you do with a throttle right?).

As an overall, I will say that the Domino feels like a disposable item I would use on toys not on motorcycles or e-bikes that can go 50 mi/h. I often screw and unscrew components off my handlebar and I wouldn't feel safe with the way the Domino is built at the handlebar. For the 90 euro I paid for this item I feel very disappointed.


### Uses a 5k resistance potentiometer

The Domino operates using a 5k potentiometer (284TBBK502A26A1). Nothing to say about that other than what I already did above when comparing it with the TPS.

### The wiring is abysmally bad

The coating is loose on the wires, wants to move down (away) which is why it probably is locked on the throttle with a zip tie (yes a zip tie) and it wrinkles heavily whenever you bend it.

![Wire wrinkles](./images/IMG_1715.jpg)

I will not exaggerate by saying that the coating is filled only half its volume by the wires, the rest is just air.

### The handle is bulkier

This can be good or bad, depending on your hand size. For me, the Domino is a little too bulky in the hand. I am 180cm/5.9 in height so take that as a reference when trying to figure out how it will be for you. The grip seems stronger with the stock throttle.

## Magura throttle review

The Magura is, in many regards, much similar with the Domino as opposed to the stock throttle. Same cheap materials here and there but with bigger twist travel and less snap when reverting to initial position. The snap is so bad that it drags heavily at times or simply fails to revert to 0 by itself. Uses a 5k potentiometer also. The grip is similar to stock so less bulk.

The wiring is better than on the Domino. Other than that, it is worst in every regard.

## My review conclusion

**If your Sur-ron is Feb 2021+**: don't waste your money because the throttles fail to work anyway and I've yet to find a fix. Resistances may need to be added or removed but I burnt Domino's potentiometer right away when trying to measure voltages out of a 5V battery (which didn't happen with the stock by the way; I got a 0.9V - 4V out).

If you have a bad wrist, maybe give the Domino a try. It has multiple points of failure when compared to stock. I know people swear by it lasting long on Zero FX or whatnot bikes but on a dirt bike I want my components to be well built and sturdy because I take this thing in the woods, up on the mountains and down in the pits.

Stay with the stock throttle for now.
